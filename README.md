# flask-gist-query
Python Flask web app that queries a Github user's Gists.

# Homage
Mr flybd5 created the inspriation for this project as found here - https://github.com/flybd5/gistquery 

# What it does 
The web app queries a Github's user's public Gists. If the user exists it pulls back the public Gists. If the user's Gists have already been queried, it reports this fact, else it reports that new Gists have been published and displays the updated data set in Json format.

# Future work
1.Extend the app to run on a more rubust server other than Flask.
2.Tie the app into a database so the query records are permanently stored, rather than to the local disk.

Happy coding!
